# Data-Science Capstone Project - Healthcare,Retail,Real Estate
DESCRIPTION

HEALTHCARE - Problem Statement
NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
Dataset Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

RETAIL - Problem Statement
It is a critical requirement for business to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.
Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits
Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value)

REAL ESTATE - Problem Statement
A banking institution requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis. 
The mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate.
A statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA. Also, there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically post data retrieval from the agencies.
The dashboard must demonstrate relationships and trends for the key metrics as follows: number of loans, average rental income, monthly mortgage and ownerâ€™s cost, family income vs mortgage cost comparison across different regions. The metrics described here do not limit the dashboard to these few.
